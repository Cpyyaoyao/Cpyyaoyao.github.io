         	<li>I like painting, and if I have spare time I would create some comics. </li><br>
         	<li>I also love reading books, like science fiction and comedy. Now I am interested in the book <i><u>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? </i> </u>Philip.K.Dick.</p></li>
          </ul>

          	<li><b>There is an interesting thing  about me.</b><br><br>
          My hands are very <u>small</u>. 
          <br>Chances are that my hands are smaller in size compared with others'.</p></li><br>

         <br><b>Here are some my small questions & answers.</b>
             <ol>
                <li><p>Pretend you are traveling through time. Write about your experience and the time you visited.</p>
                    <p>If I had chance to travel through time,I would like to visit the 2100.There will be much more advanced electronic equipment that are available to people.Humans will be able to use their technology to travel through the universe and make adventures on the other planets.</p></li>
                    <br>
                <li><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? When people solve problems as a group, they come up with better solutions that if they were to try to solve the problem individually. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer</p>
                    <p>From my perspective, it is more effective to work as a team. Through working together with other teammates,we have more of a chance to share  ideas with each other. In my studies, I often discuss with my partner on the Math questions or some recent social problems to get more ways to solve them with our opinions.</p></li>
                    <br>
                <li><p>Write about a great vision you've had recently.</p>
                    <p>Since I have read the book The Little Prince, I often dream of travelling into the universe to have a look at the Earth, the Sun and the other planets in the space. It is also a mystery for me that whether there is any creature in the other planets or not.Are they like human beings, or are they like other animals? That makes me curious to the unknown space.</p></li>
                    <br>
                <li><p>Do you think social media is beneficial to society? Yes or no? Explain why you think so.</p>
                    <p>Since social media has become an important part of our modern lives, more and more people are affected by the internet. Although social media has brought some problems, from my point of view, the social media benefits our daily lives. We are able to share our experiences with all the people through the Internet and gain more knowledge about information.</p></li>
                    <br>
                <li><p>Tell me about about your favorite imaginary/ make-believe world and explain why it is your favorite.</p>
                    <p>My favorite world is the world in the game Flower. It is a world there are no human beings and the ground is covered by flowers and grass.The player needs to control a flower to start its adventure.In this beautiful world, I can touch the nature and enjoy the wonderful scenery. The game also lets me realize the importance of protecting the environment and keeping harmony with nature.</p></li>
